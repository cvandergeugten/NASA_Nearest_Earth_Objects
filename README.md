# NASA_Nearest_Earth_Objects
Machine-Learning Projects

Dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset which contains information from NASA about particular asteroids that could be considered "near earth objects". Different machine learning algorithms were used and compared in order to predict whether or not an asteroid is considered hazardous or non-hazardous. A notebook is included for those that want to play around with the models used in this project.
